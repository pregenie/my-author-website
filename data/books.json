    "description": "Shadows of Control explores the role of psychopathy in shaping human history, arguing that many of the world's most powerful leaders and institutions have been built by individuals with little to no empathy. The book presents a deep investigation into historical events, economic structures, media, and governance, linking them to a hidden class of manipulative elites who consolidate power and control societies through deception, coercion, and systemic reinforcement.",
