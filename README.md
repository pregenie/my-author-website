## Overview

This project packages both the backend (written in Python using Flask) and a PostgreSQL database into a complete Docker container environment. With a single command, you can set up everything automatically on your laptop or on a supported cloud service. No manual editing or command-line expertise is needed!

---

## What’s Included

- **Backend (Flask App):** Handles user login, configuration, and ratings.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Stores your data.
- **Docker & Docker Compose Files:** Package the entire application into containers.
- **Automated Scripts:** The system automatically checks for the existence of the database, applies migrations (updates the database schema), and starts the application.

**Folder Structure:**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have the following installed:

1. **Docker Desktop:**  
   - [Download for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/) or [Download for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).  
   - Docker Desktop is free and provides everything needed to run Docker on your laptop.

2. **(Optional) Git:**  
   - To clone this repository. You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

---

## Running the Application Locally

Follow these steps to run the application on your own laptop:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-author-website.git
   cd my-author-website
   ```

2. **Build and Run Using Docker Compose:**

   In the root folder of the project (where `docker-compose.yml` is located), run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This command will:
   - Build the Docker image for the backend.
   - Start a PostgreSQL container with default credentials.
   - Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready.
   - Automatically check for and create the database if needed.
   - Apply any pending database migrations.
   - Start the Flask application.

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your application running!

4. **Stopping the Application:**

   To stop the containers, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running. To remove the containers, you can run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Deploying to a Cloud Service

If you want to host your application on the Internet without paying much, here are a couple of recommended low‑cost/free services that support Docker containers.

### Using Heroku (Free Tier)

Heroku supports containerized applications and has a free tier for low-traffic projects.

1. **Sign Up for Heroku:**  
   Go to [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) and create a free account.

2. **Install the Heroku CLI:**  
   Download and install the Heroku CLI from [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

3. **Log In and Create an App:**
   ```bash
   heroku login
   heroku create my-author-website-app
   ```

4. **Deploy Using Heroku Container Registry:**
   In the project root, run:
   ```bash
   heroku container:push web --app my-author-website-app
   heroku container:release web --app my-author-website-app
   ```
5. **Open Your App:**
   ```bash
   heroku open --app my-author-website-app
   ```

Heroku will automatically use your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (if needed) to build and run your app.

### Other Low‑Cost Options

- **Render:**  
  [Render.com](https://render.com/) offers a free tier for containerized apps.
- **Railway:**  
  [Railway.app](https://railway.app/) also offers free deployments with Docker support.
- **Fly.io:**  
  [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) provides a free tier and supports Docker containers.

All these services support Docker deployments. Choose the one that best fits your needs.

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker Issues:**  
  Make sure Docker Desktop is running before you execute `docker-compose up`.

- **Database Connection Errors:**  
  The default settings are provided in `docker-compose.yml`. If you change them, ensure that the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` in your Docker Compose file is updated accordingly.

- **Ports Already in Use:**  
  If port 5000 is busy, you can change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `ports` section:
  ```yaml
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"   # Change the first number to an available port, e.g., "8080:5000"
  ```

- **For Help:**  
  Refer to the official Docker documentation or the support pages for Heroku, Render, Railway, or Fly.io.

This README is designed to walk even a non-technical user through the process of cloning, running, and optionally deploying the application with minimal friction. It uses Docker and Docker Compose to abstract away all the complex details, leaving the user with only a few simple commands to run.
